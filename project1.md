# Project 1: Data Visualization Mastery

## Introduction

Welcome to Project 1. In this project, you'll have the opportunity to apply the concepts and techniques you've learned to a real-world dataset of your choosing. The essence of data visualization lies not just in the ability to create charts and graphs but in the storytelling aspect—using visual tools to convey complex information in an understandable and engaging manner. This project is your canvas to explore, analyze, and narrate your data-driven story.

## Objective

Your task is to select a dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and present your findings through a series of visualizations. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that lie hidden within the data, using the visualization skills you've developed. You are encouraged to be creative, insightful, and thorough in your approach.

## Project Requirements

1. **Dataset Selection**:
   - Choose a dataset that interests you or from [Prof. Rachel Dataset Collection](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AMRfddeMwKRaNidOV87JP1iCVn_z-Uv_). This can be from any domain (e.g., finance, healthcare, technology, sports, environment).
   - Ensure the dataset is sufficiently complex, allowing for a deep dive into EDA and visualization.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conduct a thorough EDA to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships within your data.
   - Identify any interesting trends or patterns that warrant further exploration.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create a minimum of three visualizations that highlight your findings. These can include, but are not limited to, scatter plots, line charts, histograms, bar charts, and other that we coverd in class. 
   - Each visualization should be accompanied by a caption explaining the insight or trend it is meant to convey.

4. **Project Report**:
   - Compile your findings into a comprehensive report. Your report should include:
     - An introduction to the dataset and why you chose it.
     - A summary of your EDA process and key observations.
     - Detailed descriptions of each visualization, including the rationale behind your choice of visualization type and the insights it provides.
     - A conclusion summarizing the key findings from your analysis and any recommendations or hypotheses for further research.

5. **Presentation**:
   - Prepare a short presentation (10-15 slides) summarizing your project findings. Be ready to present your visualizations and explain the story your data tells to the class. You have no more than **5 minutes** to present your finding to audience. 

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit both your project report and presentation slides by the end of Week 9 ( The week after spring break **March 20**).
- Ensure all code used for data manipulation and visualization is well-commented and included in an appendix or separate file.

### Evaluation Criteria

| Evaluation              | Criterion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Points Allotted |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Sophisticated**       | Project was submitted on time. The dataset is appropriate for the project. The work is focused and clearly organized. Data is sourced. Comments and subtitles are included. Graphs show something important about the data, axes and titles are labeled, and legends are included. The language is precise and ideas are clearly and correctly communicated to the audience. All requirements are answered thoroughly and correctly.                                | 1.0             |
| **Acceptable**          | The dataset is appropriate for the project. Data is sourced. Graphs for the most part show something about the data, axes and titles are labeled, and legends are included. The language is relatively clear and communicated to the audience. Most requirements are answered thoroughly and correctly. One of the steps above is omitted, or two or three steps are underdeveloped.                                                             | 0.8             |
| **Developing Competence** | The dataset is generally appropriate for the project. The visualization may be somewhat unfocused or underdeveloped but it does have some coherence. Problems with the use of language occasionally interfere with the audience’s ability to understand what is being communicated. Not all requirements are answered, and/or not all answers are correct, or not all requirements are met.                                           | 0.6             |
| **Inadequate**           | Project was not submitted on time. The project has at least one serious weakness. The dataset may not be appropriate for the assignment. The visualization may be underdeveloped. Problems with the use of language seriously interfere with the audience’s ability to understand what is being communicated. Not all requirements are answered, and/or not all answers are correct.                                                            | 0.4             |

### Requirements

1. **Visualization**: Create one properly labeled and titled data visualization in Python using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. The visualization must include all required elements (axes and titles labeled, legends included).
2. **Narrative**: Fully answer the introduction and conclusion sections, based on requirements.
3. **Submission Format**: Submit the final version in HTML, PDF, or as a Notebook file from Jupyter or Google Colab, via GitHub or a similar platform.
4. **Timeliness**: Submit the project on time.
5. **Language**: Submission must be carefully edited for grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure.
